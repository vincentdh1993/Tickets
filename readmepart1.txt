Programming Assignment 3

	This programming Assignment's part 1 is about wirting an inheritance code about the ticket number, price, and type of the tickets sold. By implementing different classes through inheritance, managing tickets were much efficient. There were four tickets: RegularTicket(the regular and standard ticket), WalkupTicket(which extends to RegularTicket), AdvancedTicket(which also extends to RegularTicket but also counts how many days in advance the ticket was bought), and StudentAdvancedTicket(which extends AdvancedTicket and gives the 50% discount to the students). In TestTicket class, the client code, prints the tickets in an array and tests my other classes mentioned above. Furthermore, it also calculates the total price of all 15 tickets sold.


ps. Just in case, I created two ways to put advanced days in the code. "ask()" method asks user to type in how many days before they bought the ticket.
